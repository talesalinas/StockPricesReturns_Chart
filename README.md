# Stock Prices and Returns Charts
Charts that show the prices and returns of the stocks you want, all made in python.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
First, download the file and run it in a code editor of your preference.
<br/>
Then, write in the terminal all the stock's tickers you want to analyse. Remembering that the start date is 2011-01-01, but you can change it if you want.
<br/>
At the end the program will generate three charts, one will be the normal historical stock's prices, the second will show the prices if they have started with the same price ($100.00 dollars) and the last will show how was the daily volatility of the stocks. And, if you look in your terminal at the end, it will be showing what was the average daily and anual return of the stocks.

Fell free to make the changes and improvements that you want.

<h3><i>I hope this program will be useful to you.</i></h3>
